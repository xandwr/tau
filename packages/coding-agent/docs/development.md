# Development

See the repository root `AGENTS.md` for project rules.

## Setup

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts
npm run check
```

Run from source on Windows:

```powershell
.\pi-test.ps1
```

The script keeps the caller's current working directory.

### Experimental remote harness

The remote harness server/client integration is development-only. Run it from the repository with:

```bash
PI_EXPERIMENTAL=1 ./pi-test.sh server
PI_EXPERIMENTAL=1 ./pi-test.sh client
```

`PI_SERVER_DIR` overrides the server profile and socket directory (default: `~/.tau/server`). `PI_SERVER_ID` selects the logical server ID when `--server-id` is omitted.

The `client` and `experimental/plugin` package subpaths resolve only under the `source` condition in a checkout. Their implementations and the server/client commands are excluded from npm packages and standalone binaries. `pi-client`, `pi-protocol`, and `pi-server` are development dependencies of coding-agent, not runtime dependencies. The local SDK and stdio RPC API are unchanged.

## Path Resolution

Tau runs from source or the local Node build.

**Always use `src/config.ts`** for package assets:

```typescript
import { getPackageDir, getThemeDir } from "./config.js";
```

Never use `__dirname` directly for package assets.

## Debug Command

`/debug` (hidden) writes to `~/.tau/agent/pi-debug.log`:
- Rendered TUI lines with ANSI codes
- Last messages sent to the LLM

## Testing

```bash
./test.sh                         # Run non-LLM tests (no API keys needed)
npm test                          # Run all tests
npm test -- test/specific.test.ts # Run specific test
```

`npm run check` checks formatting, types, dependency declarations, entry-point boundaries, and browser compatibility.
